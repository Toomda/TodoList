# TodoList

Hey! This is just a simple TodoList i did in 1-2 hours while talking with a friend on discord.
The Reason behind this Todolist is simple. At work I am just using typescript.. So I did all my recent projects with react and typescript.
Therefore.. I never really used javascript, so I wanted to give it a try. Was fun and almost the same as Typescript. :) 

But I think I'm gonna stick with Typescript for now, because i started programming with C++ and C# and worked 3 years as a C# / vb.net developer. 
Because of that I'm pretty used to types and really like it! Makes the Code more maintable in my opinion :>
